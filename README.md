👋 Hi, I'm Boyi Li. I am pursuing my B.Eng. degree in Computer Engineering at the ZJU-UIUC Institute.

I'm now a research intern in Rehg Lab in UIUC. I'm also very fortunate to be a research assistant in CVNext Lab advised by Prof. Gaoang Wang in ZJU.

Research Interests:

- Embodied AI
- Multimodal LLM
- Multi-Agent Systems
- Reinforcement Learning

👀 I am seeking for a summer internship or research opportunity for the summer of 2026.
